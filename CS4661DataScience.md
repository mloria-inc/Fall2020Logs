##### What is Data Science? 
* data science is an inter disciplinarry field of research that aims to design and develop automated or semi automated techniques to extract knowledge (information) from large scale data and use it for futrue purposes such as prediction, decision making, or recommendation
* it can be an integration of machine learning, statistics, big data processing, predictive analytics, and computing

##### Why is Data Science So Important Now?
* why was no one talking about it 10 years ago?
* bc now we have
  * new sources of data that did not exist before
  * new capabilities to acquire, store, and process data
  * new algorithms and methods to analyze data

##### New Sources of Data
* social networks
* world wide web
* online acitivites
* smart phone activity
* electrical health records
* body and wearable sensors
* "There was 5 exabytes of inforamtion (5x10^18 bytes)"created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every two days".  - Eric Schidt, Google, Alphabet

##### New Capabilites to Acquire, Prcess and Store Data
* the cost of data acquisition, processing, and storing data has dropped incredibly fast thanks to advances in electronics and other technologies

##### Why Python?
* python is very powerful and highly popular for datascience purposes
* python is an eaty to learn, widely used, and general purpose programming language
* python inclused unique powerful libraries designed for data science 
* python supoorts both object oriented and procedural programming styles

##### Applications of Data Science
* consumer recommender system
* speech recognition
* stock market prediction
* real estate prediction
* robotics
* spam detection
* social media / ads
* object / facial recognition
* self driving cars
* health care

##### Ingredients of Data Science
* Data : Tapid growth of massive datasets
  * ex. wwww, social networks, online activites, smart phone, wearables, sensor networks
* Machine Learning : It is applied everywhere
  * ex. reccomendation system , market prediction, speech recognition, face detection, fraud detection, spam filtering, vehicle control, medical diagnosis
* Big Data Manipulation and Processing:
  * large scale data processing, distributed computing, cloud computing
