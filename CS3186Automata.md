* asynchronus approach
* A typical weekly flow will be as follows:
* (i)A short virtual class (Monday 12.15PM for Section 1 and Tuesday (6PM for Section 2) to review the weekly activities. 
* (ii)Download PowerPoint file ahead to time.
* (iii)Watch the posted Video lectures. (The biggest facilitator in this format are the captioned videos generated over PowerPoint presentations that simulate classroom lectures. These videos can be replayed back many times to digest the concepts covered in the course.)
* (iv)Refer and read the Chapter/Section in the textbook.
* (v)Take any notes on the slides as you complete the above activities.
* (vi)Complete the Assignment on paper (as described).  (You will learn better when you process information, and that you process better when you write by hand.) Complete the assignment no later than Saturday midnight. The Assignmentwill be open throughout the week through Saturday.
* (vii)Complete the quiz in any 30 minute interval no later than Sunday night. The quiz is available on Friday/Saturday/Sunday.

##### **Chpter 1 (Section 1.1) Sets**

* a set is a collection of elements 
  *  A = {1,2,3}
  *  B = {train, bus, bicycle, airplane}
  *  C = {a, b, ... z} -> finite set
  *  S = {2, 4, 6...} -> infinite set
  *  S = {j | J > 0 , and j = 2, for some k > 0}
  *  | is such that
  *  S = {j | j is nonnegative and even}
* Set Cardinality
  * A = {2, 5, 7}
  * |A| = 3
  * just the set size
* Venn Diagram
  * as if often the case in mathematics, a picture helps clarify a concept. For sets, we use a tupe of picture called a Venn Diagram. It represents sets as regions enclosed by circular lines
* Proof Techniques
  * proof by induction
  * proof by contradiction
  * proof by counter example
  * proof by construction
